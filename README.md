Weekly Meal Planning

## Description

For busy people who don't have a lot of time, this web site provides a meal & grocery planner to simplify their busy schedule.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
When visitors come to the site, they will be provided a weekly meal planner and build a grocery list.

The motivation to built this site was two fold to build a meal planer for bootcamp students that are overwhelmed and need to eat.

We are building this website to help other people prepare their meals. Our website will help them prep and build their grocery list to get ready for the day. What our website does is for users to shop ahead of time or give them ideas what they are craving for the weekday.

## Usage

Once on the website
a person will be able to choose between vegetarian meals, 30 minuet meals, number of preselected meals, and the option to have takeout menus and links to doordash for delivery. They will also be able to select which meals are their favorite.
For the week view one can select the meal for that day from the preselected options by dropdown box. The meal choices will be stored in local storage each time they make a change.
From the meal choices they will be able to click on the option and be taken to the recipe and cooking instructions with the option to print the page.
A future feature will provide the person with a weekly shopping list for all the meals selected and provide a link to text themselves a shopping list for their phone.
