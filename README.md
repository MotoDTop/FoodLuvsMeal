Meal Planning 
## Description



For busy people who don't have a lot of time, this web site provides a meal & grocery planner to simplify their busy schedule.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
When visitors come to the site, they will be provided a weekly meal planner and build a grocery list.

The motivation to built this site was two fold to build a meal planer for bootcamp students that are overwhelmed and need to eat.

We are building this website to help other people prepare their meals. Our website will help them prep and build their grocery list to get ready for the day. What our website does is for users to shop ahead of time or give them ideas what they are craving for the weekday.

## Usage

Once on the website
Select the dropdown arrow for each day and select your desired meal.
A list of ingredients will appear bellow each meal
If you already have some of the ingredients, select them (this will remove them from the shopping list}.
Your weekly shopping list will be present at the bottom of the page, excluding the items you selected in the previous step.
